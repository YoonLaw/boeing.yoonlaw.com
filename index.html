        Announcement Regarding Lawsuit Against Pinnacle Claims Management, Inc.
        For Labor Code Violations
      </h2>
    </section>

    <section class="main-content">
      <p>
        We have filed a lawsuit against The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) in the Los
        Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 19STCV11220.
      </p>

      <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

      <p>
        The lawsuit alleges Boeing’s current and former non-union hourly-paid
        employees were not paid overtime wages for hours worked over 40 hours in
        a week. In addition, the lawsuit alleges that employees were not fully
        relieved of duty for meal periods and rest breaks and were not
        reimbursed for work-related expenses, amongst other claims. The lawsuit
        seeks money on behalf of certain hourly-paid employees of Boeing.
      </p>

      <h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>

      <p>
        We know you received a letter earlier in this case about the disclosure
        of your contact information. This letter is different because we are now
        asking for your help. We have written to you because we believe you
        would like to know more about the case and because we would like to
        speak with employees (including former employees) about their
        experiences working for Boeing. The Court has not yet decided whether
        this case may proceed as a class action and
        <strong>your input is critical</strong> to successfully resolve the
        lawsuit and achieve the maximum recovery for Boeing’s past and present
        employees.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want us to, we can request your time/payroll and personnel
        records from Boeing, which will help us build a case to get the best
        result for everyone. To get your records, we need your written
        authorization.
      </p>
